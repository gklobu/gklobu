# Let's do some Q&A

### Who are you?
Hi! I'm Gian Klobusicky. I'm a data scientist with a focus on experimentation and team building.

### What are you up to lately?
💼 I'm a Data Scientist at Meta, working mostly on experimentation and measurement strategy. I converted to tech lead manager in early 2022 so I could lead a team focused on experimental methods. 
Importantly, I don't represent Meta or any of its subsidiaries in any way. Any views that I express online or elsewhere are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of any other person, company, or entity.

📓 I'm a part-time grad student in [Columbia's QMSS program](https://qmss.columbia.edu/)


### What else have you done?

👩🏻‍💻 Worked as a data scientist/analyst/person-who-does-researchy-things at [NBCUniversal](https://www.nbcuniversal.com/), [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/), and [HBO](https://www.hbo.com)

🧠 Worked as a research assistant (RA) for cognitive science labs at [U. Rochester](https://www.unige.ch/fapse/brainlearning/) and [Temple U.](https://sites.temple.edu/cnltu/)

👩🏻‍🏫 Taught a course on analytics with python at the [NYC Data Science Academy](https://nycdatascience.com/)


### What are your research interests?

🧪 Mostly research methods, but I'm also into media and the behavioral sciences

### Where else can I find you?

You can find me on on LinkedIn and Twitter (I'm not really active on either, tbh):
